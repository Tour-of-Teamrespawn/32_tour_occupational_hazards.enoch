		<br />
		<br />
		 The war within Livonia is intensifying. The attempted Russian occupation of the region has left towns and cities devistated with increasing civilian casulaties. NATO forces are not prepared to standby idley during this humanitarian crisis. Instead they are to take an active roll in defending the already dominated Livonian Armed Forces and civilian population. The Royal Marine Corps have been tasked as a quick reaction force to move in and disrupt enemy advancements giving allied forces time to amass in the region.
		<br />
		<br />
		 The Russian forces are moving further south, and have reached key crossing points in the Livonian river. Your task is to move in and designate <marker name=""TOUR_mkrBridge"">Topolin bridge</marker> for accurate bombing by allied forces already operating within the region.
		<br />
		<br />
		<br />
		<font size='20' align='center' color='#0080ff'>Intel</font>
		<br />
		<br />
		 Local resistance fighters have already taken down the <marker name=""TOUR_mkrViaduct"">viaduct</marker> but have become overwhelmed with increasing Russian presence. You are to move in and finish the job in order to slow the Russian advance and cut off supply lines. You must ensure the safety of the civilian population and local militia.
		<br />
		<br />
		 Allied A-10's are flying sortes within the AO, but with bad weather have been unable to target the key facilities accurately without endangering the Livonian population. You will be paradropped via C130 to the <marker name=""TOUR_mkrStart"">south of Topolin</marker>. From there, regroup and push down to the <marker name=""TOUR_mkrBridge"">bridge</marker> and mark it for CAS.
		<br />
		<br />
		 Enemy infantry forces are increasing within the area, with VDV reinsforcements arriving over the <marker name=""TOUR_mkrBridge"">bridge</marker> regularly. Expect to engage numerous infantry forces within the AO, with machineguns and mortar emplacements around the <marker name=""TOUR_mkrTown"">town</marker>.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<font size='20' align='center' color='#0080ff'>Support</font>
		<br />
		<br />
		 Fire support is available for this mission by the M119 artillery units (Artemis), but limited to smoke artillery only. Soldier with a PRC-152 radio can access this through the support interface.<br /><br /> Extra ammo and medical equipment will be dropped within area for you to rearm and resupply as and when resources become available.
